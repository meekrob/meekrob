### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ Fun fact: My background is in bioinformatics and computational biology.  


### What I do
I currently work at Colorado State University as a researcher in the [Erin Osborne Nishimura laboratory](onishlab.colostate.edu). 

I am also the course coordinator for Quantitative Cell and Molecular Biology, an introductory course on bioinformatics subjects and techniques geared toward first year PhD students.
